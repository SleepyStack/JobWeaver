# JobWeaver

A distributed, event-driven job execution platform built on Spring Boot 4, Apache Kafka, and PostgreSQL. JobWeaver accepts simulation job requests via a REST API, schedules them with configurable retry logic, dispatches them to a pool of worker threads via Kafka, and tracks execution outcomes across isolated databases.

## Architecture

JobWeaver follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication through Apache Kafka. Each service owns its database and communicates exclusively via Kafka topics, enforcing strict data ownership boundaries.

For the complete architecture breakdown, see:
- [Architecture Analysis](ARCHITECTURE.md) -- detailed textual description of every component, data model, and design pattern.
- [Architecture Diagrams](ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md) -- Mermaid diagrams covering the system topology, request flow, state machine, thread model, and infrastructure layout.

### High-Level Flow

```
Client --> API (validate, persist, publish) --> Kafka [job-created]
    --> Scheduler (ingest, poll, dispatch) --> Kafka [run-job]
    --> Worker (execute, report) --> Kafka [job-completed / job-failed]
    --> Scheduler (complete or retry with backoff / dead-letter)
```

## Modules

### jobweaver-common

Shared library containing the domain contracts consumed by all three services:

- **Event records**: `JobCreatedEvent`, `RunJobEvent`, `JobCompletedEvent`, `JobFailedEvent`, `DeadLetterEvent`.
- **Simulation model**: Sealed `SimulationStep` interface with Jackson polymorphic deserialization. Step types: `SleepStep`, `LogStep`, `ComputeStep`, `HttpCallStep`, `FailStep`.
- **Exception base**: `BaseDomainException` and `DomainErrorCode` interface for namespaced error codes.

### jobweaver-api

REST gateway responsible for accepting job requests, persisting them, and publishing creation events. Exposes three endpoints under `/api/jobs`. Includes an MDC filter for trace ID propagation and a global exception handler for standardised error responses.

### jobweaver-scheduler

Consumes job creation events, persists execution records, and dispatches ready jobs on a 10-second polling interval using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Manages retry logic with exponential backoff (capped at 300 seconds) and routes exhausted jobs to a dead-letter topic.

### jobweaver-worker

Consumes dispatch events across 3 Kafka consumer threads, submits execution to a 12-thread pool, and runs simulation instructions step-by-step. Implements custom asynchronous offset management to handle out-of-order job completion. Uses `CallerRunsPolicy` for natural back-pressure when the thread pool is saturated.

### jobweaver-dashboard

React/Vite scaffold. Planned for Phase 3 development as a full monitoring and control interface.

## Key Design Decisions

| Concern | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Event-driven decoupling** | Services communicate exclusively via Kafka; no synchronous inter-service calls. |
| **Database-per-service** | Three isolated PostgreSQL instances enforce strict data ownership. |
| **Idempotent processing** | Duplicate events are detected via primary key constraints (job ID at scheduler, event ID at worker). |
| **Optimistic locking** | `@Version` on scheduler entities prevents concurrent state transition conflicts. |
| **Pessimistic dispatch** | `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` enables concurrent scheduler instances without double-dispatching. |
| **Async offset commits** | Custom `PartitionState` / `OffsetCommitCoordinator` allows out-of-order completion with correct watermark-based commits. |
| **Back-pressure** | `CallerRunsPolicy` on the worker thread pool slows Kafka polling when processing capacity is exceeded. |
| **Exponential backoff** | `min(5 * 2^retryCount, 300)` seconds between retry attempts. |
| **Structured logging** | Logback with `[service=...] [traceId=...] [jobId=...]` across all services. |
| **Sealed types** | Java 21 sealed interfaces + pattern matching for type-safe simulation step dispatch. |

    "steps": [
      { "action": "LOG", "message": "Starting job" },
      { "action": "SLEEP", "durationMs": 2000 },
      { "action": "COMPUTE", "iterations": 500000 },
      { "action": "HTTP_CALL", "url": "https://example.com", "latencyMs": 1500 }
    ]
  },

}
```

### Get Job by ID

```
GET /api/jobs/{id}
```

**Response (`200 OK`):**

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "type": "SIMULATION",

}
```

```
GET /api/jobs?type=SIMULATION&page=0&size=20

  "jobs": [ ... ],
  "page": 0,
  "size": 20,
  "totalElements": 42,
  "totalPages": 3
}
```

### Simulation Step Types

| Step | Fields | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `SLEEP` | `durationMs` (int) | Pauses execution for the specified duration |
| `LOG` | `message` (String) | Logs the message at INFO level |
| `COMPUTE` | `iterations` (int) | CPU-bound loop (sum accumulation) |
| `HTTP_CALL` | `url` (String), `latencyMs` (int) | Simulates HTTP latency via sleep |
| `FAIL` | `message` (String) | Throws a failure exception, halting execution |

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21** (JDK)
- **Maven 3.x**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

### Step 1 -- Build the Project

Build all modules from the project root:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

This compiles `jobweaver-common`, `jobweaver-api`, `jobweaver-scheduler`, and `jobweaver-worker`, producing fat JARs in each module's `target/` directory.

### Step 2 -- Start the Infrastructure

Launch all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres-api` | 5432 | API database (`jobweaver_api`) |
| `postgres-scheduler` | 5433 | Scheduler database (`jobweaver_scheduler`) |
| `postgres-worker` | 5434 | Worker database (`jobweaver_worker`) |
| `zookeeper` | 2181 | Kafka coordination |
| `kafka` | 9092 | Message broker |
| `jobweaver-api` | 8080 | REST API |
| `jobweaver-scheduler` | 8081 | Scheduler service |
| `jobweaver-worker` | 8082 | Worker service |

Docker Compose activates the `docker` Spring profile, which overrides database hosts and Kafka bootstrap servers to use Docker network hostnames.

### Step 3 -- Verify Services

Check that all services are healthy:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8082/actuator/health
```

### Step 4 -- Submit a Test Job

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jobType": "SIMULATION",
    "payload": {
      "steps": [
        { "action": "LOG", "message": "Hello from JobWeaver" },
        { "action": "SLEEP", "durationMs": 3000 },
        { "action": "COMPUTE", "iterations": 100000 }
      ]
    },
    "maxRetryCount": 2
  }'
```

### Step 5 -- Monitor Execution

Observe logs across all services:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f jobweaver-api jobweaver-scheduler jobweaver-worker
```

The structured logging output includes `traceId` and `jobId` for tracing the job across services.

### Stopping the Stack

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

The `-v` flag removes named volumes, clearing all database state.

---

## Running Tests

Run the full test suite across all modules:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run tests for a specific module:

```bash
mvn test -pl jobweaver-api
mvn test -pl jobweaver-scheduler
mvn test -pl jobweaver-worker
mvn test -pl jobweaver-common
```

All tests are unit-level and require no external infrastructure. The test suite includes 143+ tests across 32 test classes.
